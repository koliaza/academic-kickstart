  abstract  = {Todays biometric authentication systems are still struggling with replay attacks and irrevocable stolen credentials. This paper introduces a biometric protocol that addresses such vulnerabilities. The approach prevents identity theft by being based on memory creation biometrics. It takes inspiration from two different authentication methods, eye biometrics and challenge systems, as well as a novel biometric feature: the pupil memory effect. The approach can be adjusted for arbitrary levels of security, and credentials can be revoked at any point with no loss to the user. The paper includes an analysis of its security and performance, and shows how it could be deployed and improved.},

  abstract  = {Codes and passwords are the bane of user experiences: even small mistakes can delay desired activities, causing undue frustration. Work on codes has focused on security instead of peoples ability to enter them error-free. Difficulties observed in a security demonstration motivated this investigation of code transcription difficulty. A pilot study with 33 subjects and a follow-up study with 267 subjects from 24 countries measured performance and preference for codes of varying lengths, patterns, and character sets.

We found that, for users of all languages, long codes with alternating consonant - vowel patterns were more accurately transcribed and are preferred over shorter numeric or alphabetic codes. Mixed-case and alphanumeric character sets both increased transcription errors.

The proposed CVC6 code design composed of six Consonant-Vowel-Consonant trigrams is faster to enter, more secure, preferred by users, and more impervious to user error when compared to codes typically used for security purposes. An extension integrates error detection and correction, essentially eliminating typos.},

  abstract  = {Passphrases have many uses, such as serving as seeds for passwords. User-created passphrases are easier to remember, but tend to be less secure than ones created from words randomly chosen in a dictionary. This paper develops a way of making more memorable, more secure passphrases. It investigates the security and usability of creating a passphrase by choosing from a randomly generated set of words presented as a two-dimensional array. A usability experiment shows that participants using this method achieved 97% to 99% of the maximal theoretical entropy and commited fewer than half as many memory mistakes as a control group with assigned passphrases. It also shows that their choices are affected by word familiarity and weakly by the word's position in the array. Prompting a person with random words from a large dictionary is an effective way of helping them make a more memorable high-entropy passphrase.},
