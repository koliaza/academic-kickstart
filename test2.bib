Our goal in this paper is, given a connected set of balls, to select  and inflate one ball to  cover the whole set with the minimal radius. More formally, we are given  an abstract metric space and a path-connected set of balls with given centres $c_{1},c_{2},\dots, c_{n}$ and radii $r_1, r_2,\dots, r_n$. We want to choose one of the centres and create a ball of radius $R$ around it to cover the whole set of balls with minimal $R$. 
By using arguments from graph theory, we show that  $R\le r_{a}+\sum_{j}r_{j}$, where  $r_{a}$ is the mean of the two biggest radii among the $r_{i}$. This bound is tight. Finally, we show that in the usual complexity models, computing this centre requires $\Theta(n^2)$ operations. },

  booktitle = {5th Workshop on Advances in Secure Electronic Voting -- VOTING'20},
  year      = {2020},
  abstract  = {    Over the past four decades, fear of election manipulation and hacking has spurred the security technology community to propose a variety of voting systems to implement verifiable voting. 
Most of these rely on  hard to understand cryptographic protocols, which can affect whether users  actually verify their selections.  Three-Ballot and Vote/Anti-Vote/Vote, two related systems among the few non-cryptographic end-to-end verifiable voting systems, made improvements in security while eliminating complex protocols. They unfortunately suffered from usability issues, and although they did not require  cryptographic primitives, they still relied on electronic devices. To address this, we  introduce three folded-paper based systems that allow verifiable voting and resist common attacks despite not relying on any cryptography or electronic devices. The proposals are based on 1) semi-translucent  ballots, 2) masking tape, or 3) folding and punching. These Origami voting  methods help users understand the underlying mechanisms and give them a  direct geometric approach to verification.},

As passwords remain the main online authentication method, focus has shifted from naive entropy to how usability improvements can increase security.  Chatterjee et al. recently introduced the first two typo-tolerant password checkers, their second being usable in practice while being able to correct up to $32\%$ of typos, with no real security cost. 

We propose an alternative framework which corrects up to $57\%$ of typos without affecting user experience, at no computational cost to the server. },

Une quantit{\'e} croissante de donnÂ´ees dynamiques sur des r{\'e}seaux divers est disponible depuis plusieurs ann{\'e}es mais les outils pour analyser ces donn{\'e}es ne sont pas toujours adapt{\'e}s. Nous proposons d'utiliser ces donn{\'e}es dynamique pour faire des groupes d'individus de comportement similaire restant stables avec le temps. Pour cela nous introduisons une variante dynamique du probl{\`e}me Sum-Radii Clustering, en utilisant le formalisme du probl{\`e}me Dynamic Facility Location, avec la distinction que nous cherchons {\`a} minimiser le diam{\`e}tre des groupes au lieu de la somme des distances au centre. Nous {\'e}tudions deux adaptations naturelles d'algorithmes probabilistes utilis{\'e}s pour Dynamic Facility Location (marchant respectivement dans le cas g{\'e}en{\'e}eral et quand on se restreint {\`a} des espaces m{\'e}triques). Dans le premier cas, l'algorithme atteint la m{\^e}me borne d'approximation et nous proposons une am{\'e}lioration, aussi valable pour l'algorithme original (faisant passer le facteur d'approximation de O(lognT) {\`a} O(logn), o{\`u} n est le nombre de clients et T la dur{\'e}e en nombre de pas de temps). Enfin, nous montrons que dans le cas m{\'e}trique, les outils actuels ne permettent pas encore de donner un meilleur r{\'e}sultat, et exhibons un contre-exemple pour le deuxi{\`e}me algorithme, prouvant qu'il ne peut pas atteindre une approximation constante.

Clustering is an efficient tool to reduce the complexity to allow representation of the data. In 2014, Eisenstat et al. introduced a dynamic version of this classic problem where the distances evolve with time and where coherence over time is enforced by introducing a cost for clients to change their assigned facility. They designed a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta ({\backslash}ln n){\$}{\$} -approximation. An O(1)-approximation for the metric case was proposed later on by An et al. (2015). Both articles aimed at minimizing the sum of all client-facility distances; however, other metrics may be more relevant. In this article we aim to minimize the sum of the radii of the clusters instead. We obtain an asymptotically optimal {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta ({\backslash}ln n){\$}{\$} -approximation algorithm where n is the number of clients and show that existing algorithms fromÃ‚Â An et al. (2015) do not achieve a constant approximation in the metric variant of this setting.},
