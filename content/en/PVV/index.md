We recently developed Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system easily assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections. 
This sytem was built with Alan Sherman and Ryan Robucci (both from the UMBC Cyber Defense Lab) and Ted Selker, and is currently being used by multiple departments at UMBC.

This page has the relevant information if you want to learn about the system or use it.

Our initial [paper](/publication/blanchard-2021-phraseverifiedvoting/), published in Cryptologia in 2021.

A short [article](files/PVV-cohe.pdf) explaining it.
