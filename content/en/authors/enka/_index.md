I am a CNRS scientist (Chargée de Recherche = permanent research-only position) working in the [Laboratory of Automation, Mechanics and Industrial and Human Computer Science](https://www.uphf.fr/LAMIH/), [Polytechnic University Hauts-de-France](https://www.uphf.fr/en/preparing-study-here). I am also an associate researcher at the [Center for Internet and Society of the CNRS (UPR 2000)](https://cis.cnrs.fr/about/). Before this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Digitrust Consortium](http://lue.univ-lorraine.fr/en/article/digitrust-consortium) of the University of Lorraine, after having defended my PhD titled "Usability: low tech, high security" at [IRIF](https://www.irif.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in the Distributed Algorithms and Graphs Team, for which I received the PSL 2020 award for best thesis at the Science/Humanities Interface. I was advised by [Nicolas Schabanel](https://www.irif.univ-paris-diderot.fr/users/nschaban/index) and [Ted Selker](http://ted.selker.com/), with whom I worked on human usability of security and its applications to voting systems.

As I work between multiple fields, I do not have as much expertise as a specialist in a single field, which leads me to create collaborations with a large set of researchers and experts from different labs. It means that I am a member of multiple research groups such as the [Random Sample Voting Project](http://rsvoting.org/), where I am responsible for the organization of RSV elections, [Chôros](https://www.choros.place/) and the [POP Special Exploratory Committee](http://poplatform.org/), a new political party/platform where we seek to implement real-time democracy. I also recently started working on US elections with the [Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project](https://www.vote.caltech.edu/). This allows me to bridge the different fields while making sure that the methodology and end results are sound.

 I am generally extremely open to new collaborations, so don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have an idea or would like to participate in some of our projects. After a decade of activism, I also recently decided to get involved in the more academic side of queer and crip theories (and am currently trying to set up a team to translate some of the main literature on the subject into French). This recently pushed me to start a second PhD in geography, on disabled spatialities, supervised by [Jacques Lévy](https://people.epfl.ch/jacques.levy), as part of the Spatial Intelligence chair of UPHF. 

I'm currently in the process of publishing a [book](http://koliaza.com/old/book.html) on the use of randomness in politics. I'm also co-organising a [CNRS working group](https://cis.cnrs.fr/droit-et-humanites-numeriques/) on law and digital humanities, which evolved from our [seminar](http://koliaza.com/old/law-informatics.html) with colleagues from EHESS, and am organising two sessions on geography of disability in the psychopolitics seminar at EHESS. 

I am currently looking for a PhD student to probably work on eye biometrics  (without following the usual methodologies, we're not trying to remake minority report). All profiles are welcome (in priority people with a computer science or cognitive science background). The project is detailed [here](http://koliaza.com/biometrics-thesis-en.pdf).
