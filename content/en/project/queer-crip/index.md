I have a strong personal interest in Queer Theory and Crip Theory, and have been an activist for most of my life. After joining Chôros, and especially since the end of my PhD, I have been devoting a significant portion of my time to reading and writing about these issues. I am mostly interested in the intersections between trans-identity and crip-identity. I am also interested in crip spatialities and temporalities.

I have written a few texts on the subject:

- A series of papers focused on crip [spatialities]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-spatialitiesandtemporalities/" >}}), [temporalities]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-spatialitiesandtemporalities2/" >}}), and general [dimensionalities]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2022-disableddimensionality/" >}}).

- A more creative text on [travelling while crip]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-temporalexpenses/" >}}).

- An autoethnographic take on living the [intersection of crip-identity and trans-identity]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-criptransidentity/" >}}).

- A paper on the [relative absence of trans people with early physical impairments]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-wherearethetranscrips/" >}}).

- Two articles in French on the [treatment of minorities during CoViD-19]({{< ref "publication/boubli-2020-thanatopolitique/" >}}) and the resulting [thanatopolitics]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-covidminorities/" >}}).


- An article on [disabled mobilities and mathematics]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2022-temporaryobstacles/" >}}), that also covers the difficulty in creating accessibility databases. 

- An article on [trans aesthetics and urbanity]({{< ref "publication/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics/" >}}).

- A reflexion on the  [Twitter harassment](https://academia.hypotheses.org/39675) I received upon joining the CNRS.

I have  been discussed those subjects in a  [seminar on public bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiMaQ4zdwxM) and another one on [the oppositions in disability studies : francophone against anglphone, qualitative against quantitative](https://pod.uphf.fr/video/4489-20230112-seminaire-mh2-enka-blanchard/) (in French, download the video for higher quality), 

I have also been invited to the [Enjeux territoriaux](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/les-enjeux-territoriaux/le-territoire-vecu-des-personnes-handicapees-5395514) radio show on France Culture and in a [débat sans filtre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVfXQc3COM&t) organised by Cédric Villani. Finally, I gave in 2022 an introductory course on crip studies (in the Teaching tab).
