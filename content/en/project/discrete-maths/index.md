My initial training was in mathematics, more specifically graph theory, and I did work for a while with [Eldar Fischer](http://eldar.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/), [Oded Lachish](http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~oded/), and [Janos Makowski](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~janos/).

I then worked with [Nicolas Schabanel](https://www.irif.fr/users/nschaban/index) at the end of my Master's degree, and then during the first half of my thesis, with a focus on dynamic clustering.


I still try to do some research, mostly with [Siargey Kachanovich](http://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/people/siargey.kachanovich/) and SÃ©bastien Bouchard. Currently, math-wise I am mostly thinking about submanifold meshing and point location problems, as well as distributed agent problems.

Here are the different papers:

- My first paper, on the [roots of graph polynomials]({{< ref "publication/makowsky-2014-locationrootsgraph/" >}}).

- A second that came shortly after but still isn't published, on [paths in $2$-connected graphs]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-longestpaths-2/" >}}).

- Our paper with Nicolas Schabanel on [Dynamic Clustering]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2017-dynamic-sum-radii/" >}}) (and the corresponding [French paper]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2016-clustering-dynamiquepar/" >}})).

- A paper with Siargey Kachanovich on [counting the number of paths in a constrained control-flow graph]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-countingauthorisedpaths/" >}}).

- A second one on the [inflating enclosing ball problem]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-noteinflatingenclosing/" >}}).

- A preprint on [bilingual palindrome generation]({{< ref "publication/adams-2020-bilingualpalindromes/" >}}).

- A paper [on disabled mobilities]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2022-temporaryobstacles/" >}}) that does not have original mathematics but mentions an application of some percolation theory.
