I've been a member of the Random Sample Voting (RSV) Project since 2016, and I've had the opportunity to work in it with a few colleagues such as David Chaum as well as Alan Sherman, who introduced me to Ted Selker, with whom I do most of my work on voting technologies. 

Our work so far includes research on:

- [Trust for random sample voting]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2018-building-trust-sample/" >}}).

- [Difficulties in implementing voting technology]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2018-improvingvotingtechnology/" >}}).

- [Institution design]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-civics-changing-incentives/" >}}).

- [Non-cryptographic verifiable voting system]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-origamivotingnon/" >}}).

- [Design ideas for absentee voting]({{< ref "publication/selker-2020-designideas/" >}}).

- [Low-tech boardroom voting systems]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-boardroomvoting/" >}}), and [online low-tech boardroom voting for UMBC]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-remotetp/" >}})
 

I've also been invited to give a few talks on the subject: 
- at the [2016 Global Forum on Modern Direct Democracy](http://www.2016globalforum.com/) ([slides](/files/global_forum_1st.pdf)), where I organised the first public RSV demo.
- at the [2017 World Forum for Democracy](https://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy/about2017wfd), where I also organised an RSV demo. 
- at the [2018 POINT Conference on Political Accountability and New Technologies](https://www.fes-soe.org/news-list/e/point-70-conference-political-accountability-and-new-technologies/).
I also had an interview with Audrey Tang (digital minister of Taiwan) to discuss the use of new technologies in voting ([blurry video](https://youtu.be/F-39uAz98wA) and [transcript](https://sayit.archive.tw/2017-03-28-nicolas-blanchard-visit)).
