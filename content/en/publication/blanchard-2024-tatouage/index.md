abstract: "

This article investigates disabled people’s experiences of tattooing. On top of the usual aesthetic ends, disabled users have additonal reasons for body modifications, from hiding an impairment to reclaiming their bodies by embracing their non-normativity. Despite these numerous motivations, those very users who want to modify their bodies face increased obstacles, going up to the revoking of their individual rights. We analyse these obstacles through the lenses of increased policing and negation of disabled body autonomy, while making parallels with other non-normate bodies.
