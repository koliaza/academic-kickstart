  abstract = {Living with a disability involves handling many costs that the general population is not aware of, which have recently been denounced in the online \#CripTax campaign. Those costs can be split into many categories, the principal ones being financial costs (from buying specialised equipment to higher insurance premiums), psychological costs (with increased stress and mental loads), and finally temporal costs. Those temporal costs can be organised into a hierarchy, starting with the simplest costs arising from decreased efficiency when performing basic physical tasks. Well-meaning individuals and institutions, by trying to address the issues of this first layer, often create new types of temporal costs. This applies semi-recursively as new sets of measures and behaviours try to compensate those new costs. This article proposes a decomposition of those temporal costs into such a hierarchical structure, along with an analysis of how they are perceived by the public, which is a central component of the upper layers. }
