abstract: "The New Horizons mission has returned hyperspectral
data for Pluto’s surface consisting of complex, not directly modelisable spectra. A radiative transfer model
that accurately represents the complexity of the putative surface structure and mix of components poses a
high-dimensional inverse problem, with 50-60 independent variables. We develop an efficient resolution
method using progressive metaheuristics, and present
the most accurate quantitative data on Pluto’s surface
composition to date."
