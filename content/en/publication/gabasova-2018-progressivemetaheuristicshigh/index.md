abstract: "Determining planetary surface composition via remote
spectroscopy frequently requires the use of inverse
modeling, as the surface presents a complex mixture
of materials which cannot be directly identified from
the spectra. Depending on the complexity of the radiative transfer model (RTM) used, however, the inverse
problem can be nonlinear and very high-dimensional,
and the computational cost of traditional optimization
methods becomes prohibitive. We demonstrate the
utility of a multi-step metaheuristic approach for the
inversion of high-dimensional RTMs, using the example of Pluto."
