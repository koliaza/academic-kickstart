abstract: "Queerness and transidentity have had a durable relationship with cyberpunk aesthetics, re-
fl ected in both cultural works and academic refl ections. There is an evident attraction in worlds
where technological prowess allows one to evolve beyond oneâ€™s corporeal body, or to change it at
will. The noir explorations of themes such as discrimination and sex work are also strong sources
of resonance with common trans and queer experiences. Culturally, this aesthetic is indissociable
from its urban component, with the serendipity, diversity, and density of the city often at the
centre of the stories told. This refl ects the observed tendency of queer people to congregate in
urban centres, where minorities are present in suffi cient numbers to create social communities with
freer explorations around gender.
This appeared to be one of the central aesthetic currents of the global trans community until
the early 21st century. However, we now observe a change with the rise of more rural aspirations,
exemplifi ed by the recent popularity of the cottagecore aesthetic. There seems to be a growing
desire to retreat from society at large and isolate in tight-knit homogeneous communities, replacing
co-spatiality with online connectedness. This could be the result of multiple factors, among which
two seem central: the assimilation of many queers linked to the dissolution of greater federated
queer communities, and the increased prioritisation of online interactions.
Drawing from socio-geography, literary analysis and a corpus from Tumblr (a microblogging
network) this article thus seeks to explore how aspirational and representational depictions of
queerness evolved in tandem with its physical and online practices, transforming the historically
close relationship between queerness and urbanity. "
