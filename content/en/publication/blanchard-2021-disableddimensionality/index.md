abstract: "The world expects us as humans to interact as fully functional 3D manipulators who can                              
observe, manipulate, and act in three spatial dimensions. Ableism defaults people with the                          
assumption that disabled people are inferior at manipulation, imagining, and navigating the                        
world. Our experiences and the narratives we integrate from other disabled people speak to this                              
as limited imagination and consideration. In this theoretical contribution, we go over the                          
normative dimensional assumptions built into our environment and media and analyze the                        
consequences of ableism in how spaces — digital, physical, imaginary — operate in how we                              
think about the material and virtual world. We situate this ableism against disability-led                          
technology design and disability futurity that imagines a very different world of space,                          
manipulation, and possibility.
