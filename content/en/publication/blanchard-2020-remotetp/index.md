abstract: "We propose a method by which members of the UMBC CSEE Department's Promotion & Tenure 
Committee can vote remotely during the pandemic in fall 2020. This method will not add significant 
effort, time, or expense to the process. The goals are to: 
1. Assure that the outcome is accurate; 
2. enable voters to verify the correctness of the outcome and that their votes are correctly recorded and 
tabulated; 
3. provide ballot secrecy;  
4. produce a list of people who voted and a list of eligible voters who did not vote;  
5. require few steps or learning to use or administer; and 
6. be acceptable to the UMBC administration. 
Because the stakeholders are known and accountable, the method does not have to provide an extremely 
high level of security and privacy. Simplicity and usability are very important. The method requires one 
or more trusted parties. "
