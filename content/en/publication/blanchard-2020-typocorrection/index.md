abstract: " As passwords remain the main online authentication
method, focus has shifted from naive entropy to how usability
improvements can increase security. Chatterjee et al. recently
introduced the ﬁrst two typo-tolerant password checkers, their
second being usable in practice while being able to correct up to
32% of typos, with no real security cost.
We propose an alternative framework which corrects up to
57% of typos without affecting user experience, at no computa-
tional cost to the server."
