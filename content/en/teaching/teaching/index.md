I am currently employed in a research-only position, but I used to teach at the Ecole d'Ing√©nieurs Denis Diderot. Course list:
- Foundations of Computer Science at M1 level in Fall 2018.
- Foundations of Computer Science at M1 level in Fall 2017.
- Systems and Network Engineering at M1 level in Spring 2017 ([old course website](http://koliaza.com/old/fr/systeme2017.html)).
- Systems and Network Engineering at M1 level in Spring 2016 ([old course website](http://koliaza.com/old/fr/systeme2016.html)).

In 2016, we organised a [Spring School in Discrete Mathematics in Kosovo](http://koliaza.com/old/prishtina16.html) with Siargey Kachanovich, with the support of Animath. I then went to Moldova with Mardin Andler to train teachers there and try to create new Animath clubs.


I participated in the creation of the [Mathmosphere](https://www.animath.fr/mathmosphere/) education platform and created the first MOOC on it, on the subject of graph theory.

I gave an online course titled "Introduction to crip theory" to 3rd-year students on the Sciences-Po Network. I recorded 9 2-hour video sessions which I can make privately available upon request (just send me an email).
