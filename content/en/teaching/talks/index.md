I enjoy talking to high-schoolers, and appreciate giving them an intro to what research is like. I've worked with Animath (in France, Kosovo and Moldova), as well as Parimaths, giving intro to research sessions (and a [summer school](http://koliaza.com/old/prishtina16.html)), as well as a few conferences on the following subjects (in French):
- [De Poincaré à Perelman](/files/preconf_20llg_20alsa_2005022015.pdf) (with Animaths, to prepare the students to a talk by G. Besson).
- [Reconnaissance de Triangles](/files/conf_20prologin_2009052015.pdf) (for the 2015 Prologin final).
- [Baker-Gill-Solovay](/files/gill_20solovay_20baker.pdf) (at ENS Paris).

We also made a [poster on the future of democracy](/files/worldcon-democracy.red.pdf) with L. Gabasova at [Worldcon75](http://www.worldcon.fi/).

I will be at [CIRM](https://www.cirm-math.com/) on October 13th, 2022 to give a talk to highschoolers on electoral mathematics.

I'm always enthusiastic to interact with young students, and don't necessarily require a stipend (depending on whether I'm already on site, and what kind of public there is). Feel free to me a line if you want me to intervene at your institution.
