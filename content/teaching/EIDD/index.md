I am currently employed in a research-only position, but I used to teach at the EIDD. Course list:
- Foundations of Computer Science at M1 level in Fall 2018.
- Foundations of Computer Science at M1 level in Fall 2017.
- Systems and Network Engineering at M1 level in Spring 2017 ([old course website](http://koliaza.com/old/fr/systeme2017.html)).
- Systems and Network Engineering at M1 level in Spring 2016 ([old course website](http://koliaza.com/old/fr/systeme2016.html)).

Before that, we organised a [Spring School in Discrete Mathematics in Kosovo](http://koliaza.com/old/prishtina16.html) with Siargey Kachanovich, with the support of Animath. I also went to Moldova with Mardin Andler to train teachers there and create new Animath clubs.


I participated in the creation of the [Mathmosphere](https://animath.fun-campus.fr/) education platform and created the first MOOC on it, on the subject of graph theory.
