I am a postdoctoral researcher recently recruited by the [Digitrust Consortium](http://lue.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/article/digitrust-consortium-0) to create transdisciplinary research projects. Before this, I defended my PhD titled "Usability: low tech, high security" at [IRIF](https://www.irif.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in the Distributed Algorithms and Graphs Team. I was advised by [Nicolas Schabanel](https://www.irif.univ-paris-diderot.fr/users/nschaban/index) and [Ted Selker](http://ted.selker.com/), with whom I worked on human usability of security and its applications to voting systems. I'm currently in the process of publishing a book on the use of randomness in politics. I'm also co-organising a seminar on law and informatics at EHESS.

My research is heavily transdisciplinary and my main interests currently go from usable security to  institution design, empirical psychology and crip theory.  As such, I tend to work with a large set of colleagues from different labs and am a member of multiple research groups, such as the [Random Sample Voting Project](http://rsvoting.org/), where I am responsible for the organization of RSV elections. I'm also a member of [Chôros](https://www.choros.place/) and the [POP Special Exploratory Committee](http://poplatform.org/), a new political party/platform where we seek to implement real-time democracy.

[Here]({{< ref "/post/personal/" >}})'s if you want to know a bit more about me, non-professionally.
