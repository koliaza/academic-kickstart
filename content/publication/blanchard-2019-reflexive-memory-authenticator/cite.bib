 abstract = {Todays biometric authentication systems are still struggling with replay attacks and irrevocable stolen credentials. This paper introduces a biometric protocol that addresses such vulnerabilities. The approach prevents identity theft by being based on memory creation biometrics. It takes inspiration from two different authentication methods, eye biometrics and challenge systems, as well as a novel biometric feature: the pupil memory effect. The approach can be adjusted for arbitrary levels of security, and credentials can be revoked at any point with no loss to the user. The paper includes an analysis of its security and performance, and shows how it could be deployed and improved.},
