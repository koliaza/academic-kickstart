  abstract = { Nine years before Snapchat and its ephemeral messages, Aumann, Ding, and Rabin introduced the idea of everlasting security: an
encryption that could not be decrypted after a certain date, no matter the adversaryâ€™s computing power. Their method is efficient but not
adapted to real-life constraints and cannot effectively be used today. This
paper proposes a new solution that makes use of the already existing
communications from pornography distribution networks. The method
proposed has the advantage of being usable off-the-shelf by individuals
with limited technical skills.}
