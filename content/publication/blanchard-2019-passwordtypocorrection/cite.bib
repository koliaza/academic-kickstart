 abstract = {
As passwords remain the main online authentication method, focus has shifted from naive entropy to how usability improvements can increase security.  Chatterjee et al. recently introduced the first two typo-tolerant password checkers, their second being usable in practice while being able to correct up to $32%$ of typos, with no real security cost. 

We propose an alternative framework which corrects up to $57%$ of typos without affecting user experience, at no computational cost to the server. },
