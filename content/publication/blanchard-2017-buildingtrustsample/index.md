abstract: "This work explores how to build popular trust for voting systems that rely heavily on statistical tools, those being generally counter-intuitive to the general population (and even to experts). By trying out the voting system in public and letting people fiddle with it, a first level of familiarity can be achieved. To go further, integration into a larger debating platform held by a national party could give first-hand experience to the majority of the people, and would progressively build trust as the political stakes grow higher. Preliminary results seem encouraging and point out the importance of psychological and sociological factors in election organization, and the influence of user interface design."
