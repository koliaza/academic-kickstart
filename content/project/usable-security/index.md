Since August 2018, I have been working on multiple technologies to improve the human side of security, with a focus on authentication and [voting]({{< ref "project/voting/" >}}). Most of this work has been with Ted Selker, with occasional assistance from Cl√©ment Malaingre, Eli Sennesh, Levi Gabasova, Xavier Coquand and Siargey Kachanovich.

Our work so far includes research on 

- [passphrases]({{< ref "project/usable-security/" >}})

- mental password managers

- improved single-used codes for manual transcription

- typo correction for passwords, theoretically and practically

- eye biometrics for authentication
 
- everlasting cryptography using pornography
