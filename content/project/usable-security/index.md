Since August 2018, I have been working on multiple technologies to improve the human side of security, with a focus on authentication and [voting]({{< ref "project/voting/" >}}). Most of this work has been with [Ted Selker](http://ted.selker.com/), with occasional assistance from [Cl√©ment Malaingre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl%C3%A9ment-malaingre-57b165131/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Eli Sennesh](https://esennesh.github.io/), [Levi Gabasova](http://www.winterhazelly.cloud), [Xavier Coquand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavier-coquand-423161b0/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Florentin Waligorski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florentin_Waligorski) and [Siargey Kachanovich](http://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/people/siargey.kachanovich/).

Our work so far includes research on:

- [Passphrases]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2018-improvingsecurityusability/" >}}).

- [Mental password managers]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}});

- [Improved single-used codes for manual transcription]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}}).

- Typo correction for passwords, [theoretically]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}}) and [practically]({{< ref "publication/publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}}).

- [Eye biometrics for authentication]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}}).
 
- [Everlasting cryptography using pornography]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-consonant-vowel-consonants//" >}}).
