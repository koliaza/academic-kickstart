My initial training was in mathematics, more specifically graph theory, and I did work for a while with [Eldar Fischer](http://eldar.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/), [Oded Lachish](http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~oded/), and [Janos Makowski](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~janos/).

I then worked with [Nicolas Schabanel](https://www.irif.fr/users/nschaban/index) at the end of my Master's degree, and then during the first half of my thesis, with a focus on dynamic clustering.


I still try to do some research, mostly with [Siargey Kachanovich](http://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/people/siargey.kachanovich/). Here are the different papers:

- My first paper, on the [roots of graph polynomials]().


- A second that came shortly after but still isn't published, on [paths in $2$-connected graphs]();

- Our paper with Nicolas Schabanel on Dynamic Clustering (and the corresponding French paper) came shortly after but still isn't published, on [paths in $2$-connected graphs]();

- A paper with Siargey Kachanovich on [counting the number of paths in a constrained control-flow graph]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2019-countingauthorisedpaths/" >}}).

- A second one on the [inflating enclosing ball problem]().
