With the help of a number of other scientists, I have launched multiple experiments and user studies over the past few years.
We are always looking for volunteers for those, so feel free to try one of the following (as a reward, you get the link to our hypotheses and preliminary research once you're done with the study). 


Impostor syndrome in academia
If you are a young researcher or a graduate student, please consider filling the following survey and spreading it, as it could have a direct positive impact (initially for you and hopefully for our communities), no matter your field (we're doing a cross-field study).
Link to study: [https://forms.gle/hAL8WMMtuwAkiFkZ9](https://forms.gle/hAL8WMMtuwAkiFkZ9). 


Mental computation modeling
Click on this [link](http://koliaza.com/mentcompexperiment/g1), follow the instructions, and get details at the end. The goal is to build a model of mental computing costs, to have a general purpose tool to improve our other work (including the following one).


Mental-only secure password managers
We recently developed a new kind of password manager called CPS that works using only your brain, but only requires you to remember one short sentence. After initial tests on a limited group of subjects, we are looking for two dozen users who would be ready to do a longer study (with tasks twice per day, for a week). To participate, send us an email.


Crowd-sourcing semi-public data to detect nazi propaganda
We are about to launch a crowd-sourcing platform as a proof of concept to detect propaganda movies. We estimate the total user time needed to be less than 100 hours, so if you want to help out, let us know.
