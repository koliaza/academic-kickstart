  abstract = {The following temporal expenses list comes exclusively from the author's experience as a crip
academic based in France but travelling around the world with their mobility scooter. Everything
mentioned happened in recent years and only includes the peculiar, hard-to-plan-for events. Not
all events are related to disability but the impact they have is a large part of traveling as a crip,
as one has to plan for the unforeseen, lest incidents that would be at best anecdote-worthy for
someone else become disastrous.
