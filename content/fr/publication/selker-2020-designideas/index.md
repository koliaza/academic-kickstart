abstract: " Despite the renewed discussion on mail-in voting, there has been little evolution
on ballot and protocol design for this speciÔ¨Åc set of protocol constraints. This paper
describes multiple designs pertaining to ballots, envelopes and chain of custody, that
seek to improve the usability, accuracy and security of mail-in ballots. Our proposals
include stickers to show voters how many selections can be made and where, and foldable
envelopes that allows a user to slide their ballot through a viewing area in an organised
way. These proposals also address ways of reducing voting errors for people with reading
disabilities, short term memory problems, or motor difficulties."
