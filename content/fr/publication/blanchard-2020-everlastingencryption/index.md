abstract: " —Nine years before Snapchat and its ephemeral
messages, Aumann, Ding, and Rabin introduced the idea of
everlasting security: an encryption that could not be decrypted
after a certain date, no matter the adversary’s computing power.
Their method is efﬁcient but not adapted to real-life constraints
and cannot effectively be used today.
In this paper we look at potential entropy sources available
today, and propose a new solution that makes use of the
already existing communications from pornography distribution
networks, and look at its social implications. The method pro-
posed has multiple advantages stemming from the fact that
pornography is shameful in most societies, and it is usable off-
the-shelf by individuals with limited technical skills, although it
still requires some effort."
