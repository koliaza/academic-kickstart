abstract: "We analyse the problem of composing bilingual palindromes, for which the only high-quality example
known is more than 150 years old. We formalise the problem and introduce multiple partial solutions
for computer-assisted palindrome composition, as well as a comparison between the composition
diﬃculties in 15 diﬀerent pairs of languages."
