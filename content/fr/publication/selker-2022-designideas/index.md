abstract: " 
While more prevalent than ever, absentee ballots and protocols for them have barely improved over the last decades. This paper describes opportunities for improving the accuracy, security but and especially accessibility & usability of paper ballots, using low-tech methods to help voters be systematic and aware of their selections as they are making them. Our proposals include stickers to show voters how many selections can be made and where, foldable envelopes that allows a user to slide their ballot through a viewing area in an organised way and auditing techniques to improve integrity of the election as well. These approaches address ways of reducing voting errors including for people with reading disabilities, short term memory problems, or motor difficulties."
