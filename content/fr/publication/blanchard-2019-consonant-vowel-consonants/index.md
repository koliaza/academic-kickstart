abstract: "Codes and passwords are the bane of user experiences: even small mistakes can delay desired activities, causing undue frustration.
Work on codes has focused on security instead of peopleâ€™s ability to
enter them error-free. Difficulties observed in a security demonstration
motivated this investigation of code transcription difficulty. A pilot study
with 33 subjects and a follow-up study with 267 subjects from 24 countries measured performance and preference for codes of varying lengths,
patterns, and character sets.
We found that, for users of all languages, long codes with alternating
consonant - vowel patterns were more accurately transcribed and are
preferred over shorter numeric or alphabetic codes. Mixed-case and alphanumeric character sets both increased transcription errors.
The proposed CVC6
code design composed of six Consonant-VowelConsonant trigrams is faster to enter, more secure, preferred by users,
and more impervious to user error when compared to codes typically
used for security purposes. An extension integrates error detection and
correction, essentially eliminating typos.
