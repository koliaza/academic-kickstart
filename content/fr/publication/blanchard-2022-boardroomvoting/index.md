abstract: "A _boardroom election_ is an election that takes place in a 
single room --- the boardroom --- in which all voters can see 
and hear each other.
We present the first practical protocol for boardroom elections 
with ballot privacy and voter verifiability
that uses only ``low-tech cryptography'' without any computers.
The protocol combines several practical building blocks
in novel ways, including existing ones (e.g., invisible and revealing inks,
ink stamps, scales) and a few we introduce.
These new building blocks include ``foldable ballots'' that can be rotated to
obfuscate the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks,
and ``visual secrets'' that are easy to remember but hard to describe.
Although closely seated participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures that no one can  determine how any individual voted. Moreover, each voter can verify that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being able to  prove how they voted, providing 
assurance against undue influence.
In contrast with traditional paper ballot voting methods typically used in today's boardrooms, our protocol provides an alternative that offers higher outcome integrity and ballot privacy while remaining usable and paper based."
