abstract: "We present Phrase-Veriﬁed Voting, a voter-veriﬁable remote voting system assembled from commercial off-the-shelf
software for small private elections. The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally includes
their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use
in fall 2020, to vote remotely in promotion committees in a
university.
Each voter ﬁlls out a form in the cloud with their vote V
(YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P—two words entered by the voter. The system generates a veriﬁcation prompt
of the (P,V) pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help
visualize how the votes add up. After the polls close, each
voter veriﬁes that this table lists their (P,V) pair and that the
tally is computed correctly.
The system is especially appropriate for any small group
making sensitive decisions. Because the system would not
prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a
speciﬁed passphrase, it is not designed for applications where
such malfeasance would be likely or go undetected.
Results from 43 voters show that the system was wellaccepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and
introduced users to the concept of voter-veriﬁed elections.
Compared to the commonly-used alternatives of paper ballots
or voting by email, voters found the system easier to use, and
that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity."
