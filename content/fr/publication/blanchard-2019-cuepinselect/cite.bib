  abstract = {People struggle to invent safe passwords for many of their typical
online activities, leading to a variety of security problems when
they use overly simple passwords or reuse them multiple times
with minor modifications. Having different passwords for each
service generally requires password managers or memorable (but
weak) passwords, introducing other vulnerabilities. Recent
research has offered multiple alternatives but those require
either rote memorisation or computation on a physical device. This paper describes a secure and usable solution to this problem
that requires no assistance from any physical device.
We present the Cue-Pin-Select password family scheme that
requires little memorisation and allows users to create and retrieve
passwords easily. It uses our natural cognitive abilities to be durable,
adaptable to different password requirements, and resistant to attacks, including ones involving plain-text knowledge of some passwords from the family. We include a theoretical analysis of its
security according to multiple attack models. Finally, we show the
promising results of a small-scale user study that put participants
in real-life conditions for multiple days}
