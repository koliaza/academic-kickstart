 abstract = {We prove almost tight bounds on the length of paths in $2$-edge-connected cubic graphs. Concretely, we show that (i) every $2$-edge-connected cubic graph of size $n$ has a path of length $\Omeag\left(\frac\log^2n\log\logn\right)$, and (ii) there exists a $2$-edge-connected cubic graph, such that every path in the graph has length $O(\log^2n)$.},
