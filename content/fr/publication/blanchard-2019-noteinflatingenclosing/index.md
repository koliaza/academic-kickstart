abstract: " Our goal in this paper is, given a connected set of balls, to select  and inflate one ball to  cover the whole set with the minimal radius. More formally, we are given  an abstract metric space and a path-connected set of balls with given centres $c_1,c_2,\\dots, c_n$ and radii $r_1, r_2,\\dots, r_n$. We want to choose one of the centres and create a ball of radius $R$ around it to cover the whole set of balls with minimal $R$.  By using arguments from graph theory, we show that  $R <= r_a+∑_jr_j$, where  $r_a$ is the mean of the two biggest radii among the $r_i$. This bound is tight. Finally, we show that in the usual complexity models, computing this centre requires $Θ(n^2)$ operations. "
