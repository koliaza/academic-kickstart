As an archive, here are a few things I did during my studies, mostly at ENS: 

- [Slides](/files/slides_20dynamic_20facility_20location.pdf) and [report](/files/MPRI_20report_20Blanchard.pdf) for the M2 internship I had with N. Schabanel on Dynamic Facility Location.

- [Review](/files/review_20buffon.pdf) of "On Buffon Machines and Numbers" by P. Flajolet, M. Pelletier, M. Soria, done for the Analysis of Algorithms class in MPRI.

- [Independent study](/files/blanchard_TIPE.pdf) of Conway's Angel problem for the ENS entrance competition.

- [Report on a homemade heuristic to solve the Graph Isomorphism problem](/files/report_20heuristic.pdf) done for the ENS algorithmic class (code available on my github) with Tito Nguyen.

- [Slides](/files/slides_20blanchard_20internship_202014.pdf) of my internship defense, where I worked on the [Grid-Minor theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6577) by Chekuri and Chuzhoi, (internship under the direction of Saket Saurabh at IMSC in 2014).



As well as some code:

- The [RSV simulator](http://koliaza.com/rsvp/), an experiment to try to convince people of the legitimacy of sampling.
- My [github](https://github.com/koliaza) with some old projects
- [Archive](/files/datingsite.zip) for a dating site population simulator, comparing multiple systems like OkCupid
- [Archive](/files/magic.zip) for a program computing the probability of a certain hand in MTG, with redraws
- [Archive](/files/DFLR.zip) for a program computing probabilities of bad instances for DFLR
