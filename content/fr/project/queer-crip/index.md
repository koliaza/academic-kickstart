I have a strong personal interest in Queer Theory and Crip Theory, and have been an activist for most of my life. After joining Ch√¥ros, and especially since the end of my PhD, I have been devoting a significant portion of my time to reading and writing about these issues. I am mostly interested in the intersections between trans-identity and crip-identity. I am also interested in crip spatialities and temporalities.

I have written a few texts on the subject:

- A paper focused on crip [spatialities]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-spatialitiesandtemporalities/" >}}).

- A more creative text on [travelling while crip]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-temporalexpenses/" >}}).

- A more formal analysis of the [temporal taxes]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-timetaxes/">}}) featured in the previous text.

- An autoethnographic take on living the [intersection of crip-identity and trans-identity]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-criptransidentity/" >}}).

- A paper on the [relative absence of trans people with early physical impairments]({{< ref "publication/blanchard-2020-wherearethetranscrips/" >}}).
